        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Last Updated: November 8, 2025</p>
        <p>At YouDown, we prioritize your privacy. As a non-intrusive utility service, we maintain a strict policy regarding the collection and use of user data.</p>

        <h2>Data Collection Policy (Zero Data Collection)</h2>
        <p>We are a zero-registration service. We do not require, collect, or store any personal data from our users, including names, email addresses, or demographic information.</p>
        
        <h2>Information Logged</h2>
        <p>Since video processing requires external network calls, certain non-personal data is briefly handled by our servers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Video URLs:** The link you input is processed momentarily to extract metadata and stream the video. It is not permanently logged or associated with any individual user activity.</li>
            <li>**IP Address:** Your IP address is necessary for network communication and is logged by our hosting provider (Vercel/proxy service) for security and debugging, but we do not actively store or analyze this data for user identification.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cookies and Tracking</h2>
        <p>We use minimal cookies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Functional Cookies:** Necessary for site operation (e.g., tracking download state).</li>
            <li>**Third-Party Advertising Cookies:** Google AdSense uses cookies to serve personalized ads. By using our site, you consent to the use of these cookies, which are managed directly by Google.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third-Party Disclosure</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your non-existent identifiable information to outside parties. Video processing is managed by third-party libraries (like yt-dlp) and proxy services necessary for the tool's core function.</p>

        <h2>Consent</h2>
        <p>By using our website, you hereby consent to our Privacy Policy and agree to its terms.</p>
        <p>If you have questions, please use the contact information provided in our Terms of Service.</p>
